# Deamer Algorithm

## Overview

This library contains several algorithms used by Deamer and related projects.

The following algorithms are present:

| Datastructure | Algorithm                     |      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ---- |
| Tree          | DFS (Iterative and recursive) |      |
| Tree          | BFS                           |      |
| Tree          | Inplace                       |      |
